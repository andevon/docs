## **What are Tools?**

Tools in Assistant-Engine are resources that assist assistants in performing their tasks. You can create tools that utilize external APIs or internal services, and they are configured using an OpenAPI schema.

## **Creating a New Tool**

Hereâ€™s how to create a new tool and integrate it with an OpenAPI schema:

1. **Navigate to the Tools Section**:
   - In the **Projects** panel, select your project (e.g., `reqms.ai | SaaS Platform`).
   - Click on **Tools** in the sidebar.

2. **Create a New Tool**:
   - Click on **Add Tool** to open the tool creation form.

3. **Enter Tool Details**:
   - **Title**: Name your tool (e.g., "reqms.ai Internal API").
   - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the tool and its purpose. This helps in understanding what the tool does within the context of the project.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Title: reqms.ai Internal API
Description: This tool allows the assistant to interact with the internal API of the reqms.ai platform to manage product ideas and related tasks.
```

4. **Provide the API Definition (OpenAPI Schema)**:
   - In the **API Definition** section, include the OpenAPI schema that defines the API's endpoints, request and response formats, and other relevant details.

**Example API Definition:**

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: reqms.ai Internal API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /products/{id}/ideas:
    get:
      tags:
      - ideas
      summary: List all product ideas
      operationId: getAllIdeas
      parameters:
      - name: id
        in: path
        description: The id of the product
        required: true
        schema:
          type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A list of product ideas
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProductIdea'
  /products/ideas:
    post:
      tags:
      - ideas
      summary: Create a new product idea
      operationId: createProductIdea
      requestBody:
        description: Product idea data
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProductIdeaCreate'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Product idea created successfully
components:
  schemas:
    ProductIdea:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
    ProductIdeaCreate:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
```

- Paste your OpenAPI schema in the provided field.

5. **Save the Tool**:
   - After filling in all the necessary details, click **Submit**. Your tool will now be available for use by assistants within the project.

## **API Key Generation**

To interact with the Assistant-Engine via API, you need to generate an API key:

1. **Navigate to the Projects Section**:
   - Select your project from the **Projects** panel.

2. **Go to the API Keys Tab**:
   - Click on the **API Keys** tab within your project overview.

3. **Create an API Key**:
   - Click **Create Token**.
   - Name your token (e.g., "staging") and save it.

You can now use this token to authenticate your API calls.
