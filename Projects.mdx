## **What are Projects?**

Projects are the primary containers for your tasks, assistants, and tools. To create a new project:

## **Creating a Project**

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section in the Assistant-Engine admin panel.
2. Click on **New Project**.
3. Enter a project name and description (e.g., `reqms.ai | SaaS Platform`, `All AI Assistants & Tasks for reqms.ai`) and click **Submit**.

> **Note:** Each project in Assistant-Engine operates in isolation, ensuring that tasks, assistants, and tools are compartmentalized. This isolation enhances security and allows for tailored configurations per project.

You will now see your project listed in the admin panel under the section "Projects".
