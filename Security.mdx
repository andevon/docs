Here are some best practices to keep in mind when setting up Assistant-Engine:

- **API Key Management**: Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
- **Access Control**: Use role-based access control within the admin panel to restrict access to sensitive features.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access to specific IP addresses to enhance security.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
- **Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS.
