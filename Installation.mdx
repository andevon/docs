## **3. PHP SDK Installation**

To begin, install the Assistant-Engine PHP SDK via Composer:

```bash
composer require assistant-engine/sdk
```

## **4. Filament Plugin Installation (Optional)**

To use the pre-built UI components in Filament, install the Filament plugin via GitHub:

XYZ

**[INSERT SCREENSHOT OF FILAMENT PLUGIN INSTALLATION HERE]**

Alternatively, you can create your own components by directly using the Assistant-Engine API, giving you full control over the integration and customization.

## **5. Environment Configuration**

Add your Assistant-Engine API key to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
ASSISTANT_ENGINE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Ensure your Laravel application is properly configured to use this key:

```php
// config/assistant-engine.php

return [
    'api_key' => env('ASSISTANT_ENGINE_API_KEY', ''),
];
```

> **Note:** Reference the [API Key Generation](#api-key-generation) section in the Core Concepts part for details on how to obtain your API key.

> **Security Tip:** Ensure that your `.env` file is excluded from version control systems like Git to prevent exposing your API keys. Consider using environment variable management tools or services for enhanced security.
