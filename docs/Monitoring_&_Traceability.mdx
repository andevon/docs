Assistant-Engine provides extensive monitoring and traeability possibilities based on your subscription plan. You can track and analyze all AI interaction history, including messages, instructions, context, tool usage, and detailed API call (timing) information.

The feature is designed to help you debug and optimize tasks and assistants performances by reviewing how each execution was handled.
Additionally you can keep track of llm usage and potential causes for high llm cost 

## **Monitoring Metrics**

You can monitor various metrics such as:

- **Timings** (Pro Plan): Track how long tasks take to execute. See Run steps and Run duration as well as status (`incomplete`, `completed`)
- **Tool Calls**: Monitor the tools called in the selected run and their request and response details.
- **LLM Configuration**: For every message sent you can view historic information about **Instructions**, **Context**, **Tools**, **User Message, Chat History & LLM Response** used as well as the total **Raw Data** sent to and received from the LLM.
