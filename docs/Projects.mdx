## **What are Projects?**

Projects are the primary containers for your tasks, assistants, and tools. 
Depending on your subscription plan, you have a limit to the number of projects you can create. 
Assistant-Engine allows you to organize and manage these projects efficiently, ensuring that all related workflows, automations, and AI-driven tasks are centralized in one place for seamless execution and tracking.‚Äù
