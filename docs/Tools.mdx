## **What are Tools?**

Tools in Assistant-Engine are resources that tasks and assistant use to accomplish their job. 
You can create tools that utilize external APIs or internal services, and they are configured using an OpenAPI schema.
Assistant-Engine allows seamless integration and management of these tools via the admin panel, enabling dynamic, context-aware execution of tasks by connecting to external systems or leveraging internal functionalities based on user-defined configurations.

## **Creating a New Tool**

Hereâ€™s how to create a new tool and integrate it with an OpenAPI schema:

3. **Enter Tool Details**:
   - **Title**: Name your tool (e.g., "reqms.ai Internal API").
   - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the tool and its purpose. This helps in understanding what the tool does within the context of the project.
   - **Provide the API Definition (OpenAPI Schema)**: In the **API Definition** section, include
      - **Endpoint:** Endpoint url
      - **OpenAPI Schema:** OpenAPI schema that defines the API's endpoints, request and response formats, and other relevant details.

5. **Save the Tool**:
   - Confirm that you have the necessary rights and permissions to upload and use the API.
   - Click **Submit**. 
    Your tool will now be available for use by Tasks and Assistants. For details on how to connect the tool check out the [Tasks](/docs/Tasks#add-tools) and [Assistants](/docs/Assistants#add-tools) documentation.
