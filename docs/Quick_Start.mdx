> **Note:** In Assistant-Engine, a 'Call' refers specifically to interactions with the OpenAI API, and it includes the following actions:
> - The execution of a task.
> - The creation of a new conversation.
> - The processing of a new message within an existing conversation.  
> 
> Each of these actions triggers a new AssistantThreadRun with OpenAI in the background. Even if an error occurs during the AssistantThreadRun, it still counts as a call. Internal services that do not involve OpenAI are not counted toward your call limit. This ensures that only interactions that directly utilize the OpenAI API affect your call count.


Once you have access to the Assistant-Engine admin panel to begin integrating AI into your projects.
