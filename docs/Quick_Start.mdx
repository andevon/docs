## **PHP SDK Installation**

To begin, install the Assistant-Engine PHP SDK via Composer:

```bash
composer require assistant-engine/sdk
```

## **Filament Plugin Installation (Optional)**

Assistant-Engine comes with free to use pre-built UI components for Filament.



Alternatively, you can create your own components by directly using the Assistant-Engine API, giving you full control over the integration and customization.

## **Environment Configuration**

Add your Assistant-Engine API key to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
ASSISTANT_ENGINE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Ensure your Laravel application is properly configured to use this key:

```php
// config/assistant-engine.php

return [
    'api_key' => env('ASSISTANT_ENGINE_API_KEY', ''),
];
```

> **Note:** For details on how to obtain your personal access token see the [API Key](/docs/Projects#api-key) section in [Projects](/docs/Projects).

> **Security Tip:** Ensure that your `.env` file is excluded from version control systems like Git to prevent exposing your API keys. Consider using environment variable management tools or services for enhanced security.
