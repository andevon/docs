## **What are Tasks?**

Tasks are units of work that your assistants will perform based on your predefinition in the admin panel. 
They are usually used to run upon button click in the frontend (e.g. by our pre-built UI compontents).
Typical tasks include "Translate", "Simplify Text", "Check Syntax", etc.


## **Creating a Task**

To create a new task:

1. Within your project, navigate to the **Tasks** section.
2. Click on **New Task** or **Create Task**.
3. Fill in the task details:
   - **Title**: A concise name for the task (e.g., "Simplify Text").
   - **Description**: A description of what the task is supposed to do.
   - **Expected Output**: The desired outcome of the task.

**Example Task Description:**

```plaintext
Title: Simplify Text Task
Description: The task receives a text input and outputs
 a simplified version of it.
Expected Output: A concise and clear version of the input text.
```


4. Fill in Agent Details for the task:
   - **Model**: Choose the model you want the task to run (GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini).
   - **Max. prompt tokens**: You can set a token limit for llm request to cap the token count to ensure communication with the llm does not cause unexpectedly high costs (Might negatively influence performance)
   - **Max. completion tokens**: Option to set a token limit for llm response
   - **Truncation Strategy**: Default is set to "auto". Option to choose "Last Messages" enabling possibility to set manual max "Last Message Count" to include in llm request.
   - **Instructions**: A description of how the task is supposed to be completed.

**Example Agent Configuration:**

Instruction: You are a principal text writer. Your are given 
a text and your job is to make it better undestandable for 
the reader. Make sure not to loose any information when updating 
the text. Keep the general tone of the input text. Only answer 
with the text and nothing more.
```

Save the task. You can now see it listed in the Tasks section.
