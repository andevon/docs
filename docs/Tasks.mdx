## **What are Tasks?**


Tasks are units of work that your assistants will perform based on your predefinition in the admin panel. 
Typical tasks include ‘Translate,’ ‘Simplify Text,’ ‘Check Syntax,’ etc. 
Assistant-Engine via API and admin panel enables automated execution of these predefined tasks through either user-triggered actions in the UI 
or background automation, allowing users to streamline repetitive processes and enhance efficiency and precision in their application workflows.


## **Creating a Task**

To create a new task:

1. Within your project, navigate to the **Tasks** section.
2. Click on **New Task** or **Create Task**.
3. Fill in the task details:
   - **Title**: A concise name for the task (e.g., "Simplify Text").
   - **Required Context:** Specify the array keys that must be present when the task is invoked via the API to ensure proper execution.
   - **Description**: A description of what the task is supposed to do.

4. Fill in LLM Settings for the task:
   - **Model**: Choose the model you want the task to run (GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini).
   - **Max. prompt tokens**: You can set a token limit for LLM request to cap the token count to ensure communication with the LLM does not cause unexpectedly high costs (Might negatively influence performance)
   - **Max. completion tokens**: Option to set a token limit for LLM response
   - **Truncation Strategy**: Default is set to "auto". Option to choose "Last Messages" enabling possibility to set manual max "Last Message Count" to include in LLM request.
   - **Instructions**: A description of how the task is supposed to be completed.

**Example Agent Configuration:**

```plaintext
Model: GPT-4o
Instruction: You are a principal text writer. Your are given 
a text and your job is to make it better undestandable for 
the reader. Make sure not to loose any information when updating 
the text. Keep the general tone of the input text. Only answer 
with the text and nothing more.
```

> **Note:** Crafting an effective prompt is a balance between precision and brevity. It should be specific enough to achieve the desired outcome, yet concise to minimize costs and avoid overwhelming the LLM, ensuring optimal comprehension. For further guidance, refer to the [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guidebook](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

Save the task. You can now see it listed in the Tasks section.

## **Add Tools**

If you want to add [Tools](/docs/Tools) for your Task to work with you can link them as follows:

   - If you have not yet defined a Tool you need to do so by navigating to the [Tools](/docs/Tools) section first.
   - Once set up, in your Task Overview click on "Add Tool"
   - Select a predefined Tool from the dropdown and click **Submit**
   - If you want to add more tools repeat these steps
