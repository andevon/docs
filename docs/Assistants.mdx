## **What are Assistants?**

Assistants are designed to perform more complex, iterative tasks based on the configurations you provide. 
They are typically but not necessarily used in chat assistants such as our pre-built UI components for Filament and Laravel.
Assistant-Engine ensures seamless integration via the admin panel, handling user requests by considering predefined context and logic. 
It manages the flow from user interaction to action, connecting with APIs and executing tasks efficiently according to the setup established in the admin panel.

## **Setting Up an Assistant**

1. **Navigate to the Assistants Section**:
   - In the **Projects** panel, select your project (e.g., `reqms.ai | SaaS Platform`).
   - Click on **Assistants** in the sidebar.

2. **Create a New Assistant**:
   - Click on **New Assistant** (or **Create Assistant** if you have not yet created any) to open the assistant creation form.

3. **Enter Assistant Details**:
   - **Title**: Name your assistant (e.g., "Product Assistant").
   - **Key**: A unique slug is generated from the title used to identify the individual assistant in API requests.
   - **Model**: Select the AI model that will power this assistant. For example, choose `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` depending on your requirements.
   - **Instructions (Greeting)**: Define the role and responsibilities of the assistant. This includes its interaction model, context, and specific instructions it should follow.

      by the product owner. Ask questions if necessary for clarification.
   2. Use of Tools: Determine the most efficient tools and 
      methods for task completion.
   3. CRUD Requests: Use the internal API to load schema 
      definitions or operation details beforehand.
   4. Make a Plan: Use a "Chain-of-Thought" approach to 
      break down the tasks. Seek feedback from the product 
      owner if needed.
   5. Execution: Implement the plan, assisting the product 
      owner in their role.
   6. Feedback: Inform the product owner of the actions taken 
      but don’t go into details unless required.

      actions or questions in a separate message.

Greetings Instructions:
   Be formal and polite.

> **Note:** Crafting an effective prompt is a balance between precision and brevity. It should be specific enough to achieve the desired outcome, yet concise to minimize costs and avoid overwhelming the  LLM , ensuring optimal comprehension. For further guidance, refer to the [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guidebook](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).


After entering the instructions, click **Submit**.

## **Advanced Settings**

Upon Assistant creation you can add further optional settings by clicking anywhere in the **Agent Details** Section:

   - **Max prompt tokens:** Limit the amount of tokens sent to the  LLM  in order to prevent excessive  LLM  costs.
   - **Max completion tokens:** Limit the amount of tokens received from the  LLM  to prevent excessive  LLM  costs.
   - **Truncation Strategy**: Set to **Auto** by default. Let's you define the number of **Last Messages** sent to the  LLM .

## **Add Tools**
   
If you have already set up tools, you can assign them to the assistant for use in its tasks. This enhances the assistant’s capabilities, allowing it to perform specific functions such as making API calls or interacting with external services.
