Assistant-Engine enables you to check every execution down to the last word including a variety of features.

## **Viewing Task or Assistant History**

To monitor and trace the execution of tasks:

1. Go to the **Tasks** or **Assistants** section depending on which history you want to check.
2. Select a task or assistant and click on the *History* tab to view its execution history. You will see a list of all the times the task was executed, along with details such as status and output.

This feature helps you debug and optimize task and assistant performances by reviewing how each task was handled.
