## **Managing Multiple Tenants**

If your application needs to support multiple tenants:

1. Ensure that each tenant has a unique project within the Assistant-Engine.
2. Manage tenants by creating and assigning them to their respective projects within the admin panel.

This allows you to isolate tasks, assistants, and tools per tenant.
